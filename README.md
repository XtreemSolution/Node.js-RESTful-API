# Application programming interfaces

APIs (application programming interfaces) enable software applications to communicate with other pieces of software consistently. Either internally to connect to a component of the application or externally to connect to a service.

# RESTful Web Services

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and is used to access and manipulate data using several stateless operations. These operations are integral to the HTTP protocol and represent an essential CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner similar to inter-process communication on a single computer. This interoperability (e.g., communication between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux applications) is due to the use of open standards.

Web services based on REST Architecture are known as RESTful web services. These webservices uses HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, which provides resource representation such as JSON and set of HTTP Methods.

#Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs server-side. Within that environment, we can use JavaScript to build our software, our REST APIs, and invoke external services through their APIs. This fact is especially convenient for developers who are crossing over from front-end development as they should already be familiar with JavaScript, making the transition more natural. It also has the bonus of unifying all of the codebase under a single programming language.

* Node.js is an open source server environment
* Node.js is free
* Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
* Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

The HTTP operations available are:

* POST (create a resource or generally provide data)
* GET (retrieve an index of resources or an individual resource)
* PUT (create or replace a resource)
* PATCH (update/modify a resource)
* DELETE (remove a resource)
